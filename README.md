The "src" folder in this directory contains the Java source code for the MyMusicList application. This application lets users create and manage personal lists of favorite music. This application was created in a group of four people including me. I was mainly  responsible for connecting the application to the Spotify Web API.

Members of this group were: Fernando Villarreal, Eric Cortes-Aguilera, William Higdon, and Quinn Tjin-a-soe.

The following are required to run this application from an IDE:

A JDK with Java 8 and JavaFX, a JSON-Java package (org.json), and cURL.
